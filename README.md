This is my submission for The GameDev.tv Game Jam 2023.

## Theme (Life in 2 dimensions!)
Two friends are seperated by a mysterious force. Coordinate and escape the mysterious realm!
Red should code movement instructions so that Blue can follow it and find a way to escape the mysterious realm.

Note: This game is still in early access. More levels will be available soon!
